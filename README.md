# Zero_Seo

What search engines read beyond the page itself: structured data
(schema.org JSON-LD: products with their offers, breadcrumbs, the store and
its search), hreflang links between a store's languages, canonical URLs
for products and categories, and a meta description where a page has none.

## Install

Requires Magento Open Source 2.4.7–2.4.9 and PHP 8.2–8.4.

```bash
composer require fixstacks/module-zero-seo
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile           # production mode
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy # production mode
bin/magento cache:flush
```

Composer installs `fixstacks/module-zero-core` with it.

Part of [`fixstacks/zero`](https://fixstacks.com/zero), which installs the Zero theme and every Zero module at once.
